**Google Apps Script for todo.txt.**

This is a GAS web app implementation of todo.txt.  You can [use the app](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzcntBct4MRcuDW8XRlPorxdntSBY72qcaimR8_hyKT-yC_ATQoHXU0RGgjygzM0vSe/exec) or you can create the .gs and .html files in your own Google Apps Script directory and deploy the script (detailed instructions coming soon).  I will endeavor to keep this repository up to date, but the latest version will be available on [Google's script site](https://script.google.com/d/1iz6xOoAMOKZQMVXL1YjjOnFEtwbX5hNmJ_6W70tml0EOol0MpNmmrihu/edit?usp=sharing).

**Disclaimer: Back up your todo.txt file or just create a new one before testing! If you fail to back up your file, you can always recover it using the file versioning on Google Drive. Use at your own risk!**

I have been using todo.txt for well over a decade. Unfortunately, I think there may only be two (one?) other people on the planet who still do. Ben Hughes's Window's app hasn't bee updated for some time (although it still works) and the same goes for Mark Janssen's Simpletask for Android which I still use, but it only lives on in GitHub forks. The official todo.txt was removed from Google Play years ago.

In an effort to forestall the inevitable of moving to Microsoft ToDo (the leading replacement candidate at this point but which is still significantly lacking features), I made a GAS web app. You can try it (you'll need to jump through all the hoops agreeing that the world will end if you authorize the script to run on your account) and see the code at the links above. It is a work in progress, but is very functional and does pretty much everything I want it to. I've tested it with up to 1,000 tasks and it has been very fast and reliable.

...now I just need to get (write?) an app to replace Simpletask before it goes the way of todo.txt on Android.
